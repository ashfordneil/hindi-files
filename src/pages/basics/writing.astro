    <h1>The Writing System</h1>
    <p>
        Hindi is typically written in the Devanagari script, which is a
        left-to-right writing system that makes heavy use of ligatures. Compared
        to the Latin alphabet we use in English, the Devanagari script is
        actually a lot more descriptive, phonetic, and structured.
    </p>
    <h2>The Letters</h2>
    <p>
        Here are the consonants. Well&hellip; some of the consonants. I&rsquo;ve
        pulled these ones out separately because they have a neat property:
        each consonant in this list has a buddy. For any "core sound" that
        you&rsquo;d want a consonant for, Devanagari has one consonant for just
        that sound, and one for a "breathy" version of that sound. For the
        phonics nerds out there, these are the "occlusive" consonants according
        to Wikipedia.

        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ट">
            Makes a "t" sound. Specifically the sort of "t" sound you&rsquo;d
            make with your tongue curled up and touching the top of your mouth.
        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ठ">
            Makes a breathy "t" sound. Specifically this is a breathy
            <span lang="hi">ट</span>.

    </LetterTableContainer>
    <p>
        Here are some more consonants. This is most of the rest of the
        consonants. At this point we have stopped grouping things by what sort
        of sound they make, and have started grouping things by whether I
        understand them. These are the remaining consonants that I actually know.
    </p>
    <LetterTableContainer>
        <LetterTable letter="ह">Makes a "h" sound. Like in "hi".</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="य">Makes a "y" sound. Like in "yes".</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="श">Makes a "sh" sound.</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="र">
            Makes a "r" sound. Ideally this should probably be a rolled "r", but
            it's not a sustained rolled "r" so as long as you make the sound by
            curling your tongue back rather than with your jaw it should be
            fine.
        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ल">Makes a "l" sound. Like in "like".</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="स">
            Makes a "s" sound. Like in "sound".
        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="न">
            Makes an "n" sound. There are a few other "n" sounding consonants
            below, and I do not know the difference. However, this is the most
            common "n" sound that I have come across.
        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="व">
            Makes a "v" or "w" sound. Much like how english doesn&rsquo;t
            distinguish between <span lang="hi">ट</span> or
            <span lang="hi">त</span>, Hindi doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between
            "v" or "w". You can say either and it&rsquo;ll be fine, and you
            need to treat them as the same when you are listening.
        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="म">Makes an "m" sound.</LetterTable>
    </LetterTableContainer>
    <p>
        Alright and here are the rest. Hopefully one day I&rsquo;ll be able to
        move these consonants into the sections above.
    </p>
    <LetterTableContainer>
        <LetterTable letter="ङ">Some sort of "n".</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ञ">Another sort of "n".</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ण">Yet another "n".</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ष">
            Another variant of the "sh" sound. Not sure what makes this
            different to <span lang="hi">श</span>.

    <p>
        And next up, here are some vowels. These also come mostly in pairs, with
        each having a shorter and longer form.

        <LetterTable letter="अ">
            Technically "a", but think "u" in "up".

        <LetterTable letter="आ">
            An "ahh" sound (not screaming, though).
        </LetterTable>

            An "i" sound, like in "image".
        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ई">An "ee" sound.</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="उ">
            A short "ooh" sound. Sort of abrupt.

        <LetterTable letter="ऊ">A longer "ooh" sound.</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ए">
            An "eh" sound. Sort of abrupt.
        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ऐ">An "air" sort of sound.</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ओ">
            An "o" sound. Like in "opportunity.
        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="औ">An "or" sound.</LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="औ">
            Sorry I don&rsquo;t know this one yet.
        </LetterTable>
        <LetterTable letter="ऑ">
            Don&rsquo;t know this one either at present.

    <h2>The Missing Vowel</h2>
    <p>
        For all that Devanagari has letters for everything, there is (at least)
        one IPA vowel that Devanagari does not have a way to write. That is the
        <span lang="und-Latn-fonipa">Ə</span>, which is the "weak vowel" in
        English. I&rsquo;m well out of my depth here, but it&rsquo;s that short
        "uh" sound that comes out if you talk in a hurry and stop trying to
        differentiate consonant sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        When in the Devanagari script, the <span lang="und-Latn-fonipa">Ə</span>
        sound is actually implied unless you deliberately write that it should
        not be included. Specifically, after every consonant is an implied
        <span lang="und-Latn-fonipa">Ə</span> by default. To join a consonant to
        the letter after it directly, without this implicit sound between them,
        Devanagari uses a ligature-like construction to connect a consonant to
        the letter after it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though this is technically we can treat this implicit
        <span lang="und-Latn-fonipa">Ə</span> behaviour as a single rule, it
        makes more sense when you break it up into two different cases and
        explain those.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Consonant next to consonant</dt>
        <dd>
            By default, if you write two consonants next to each other they have
            an implied <span lang="und-Latn-fonipa">Ə</span> between them. Think
            <span lang="hi">सक</span>. To properly join the consonants, the
            first is written differently, in a way that attaches it more
            closely to the second. This is called a "half letter" and looks
            like this: <span lang="hi">स्क</span>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Consonant next to vowel</dt>
        <dd>
            In almost all (maybe even actually all) cases, you cannot write a
            consonant next to a vowel with the implicit
            <span lang="und-Latn-fonipa">Ə</span> between them. The joined
            letters are the default way of writing a consonant next to a vowel,
            and actually the only way vowels get written out fully like in the
            above lists is when they are following other vowels, or at the
            start of a word.
        </dd>

    <h2>Joined letter combinations</h2>
    <p>
        Yeah so I&rsquo;m not writing these out by hand. This section will have
        to wait until I can be bothered writing code to populate it.
